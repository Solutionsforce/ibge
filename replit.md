# IBGE Trabalhe Conosco Web Application

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that recreates the "Trabalhe Conosco" (Work With Us) portal for IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). The application provides information about job opportunities and public contests at IBGE, featuring a clean, accessible interface that matches the official government design standards.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple Flask MVC pattern with server-side rendering:

- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL configured (ready for SQLAlchemy integration)
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server with autoscale deployment target

### Application Flow Architecture

The application has two distinct navigation flows:

1. **Main Website Flow**: Standard informational pages (/, /concursos, /processos_seletivos, /estagios, etc.) that redirect back to the homepage after user interactions
2. **Registration Flow**: Initiated by clicking "INICIAR INSCRIÇÃO" button, which leads to `/login` page and will continue to additional registration pages. This flow is separate from the main website navigation and represents the actual application process.

## Key Components

### Backend Components
- **Flask Application** (`app.py`, `main.py`): Core application setup with session management
- **Routes** (`routes.py`): URL endpoints handling main pages and API endpoints
- **Templates** (`templates/`): Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering
  - `base.html`: Base template with common layout and styling
  - `index.html`: Main page template extending base template

### Frontend Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS framework with custom CSS (`static/css/style.css`)
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality (`static/js/main.js`) including:
  - Accordion components
  - Cookie banner management
  - Navigation handlers
  - Accessibility features

### Configuration
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `pyproject.toml` with uv lock file
- **Environment**: Configured for Replit deployment with Nix packages
- **Server**: Gunicorn with auto-reload for development

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**: Flask routes receive HTTP requests
2. **Template Rendering**: Jinja2 templates render HTML with context data
3. **Static Assets**: CSS/JS files served directly for client-side functionality
4. **API Endpoints**: JSON responses for AJAX interactions (cookie acceptance)

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask 3.1.1**: Web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1**: Database ORM (ready for PostgreSQL integration)
- **Gunicorn 23.0.0**: Production WSGI server
- **email-validator 2.2.0**: Email validation utilities
- **psycopg2-binary 2.9.10**: PostgreSQL adapter

### Frontend Libraries
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework (CDN)
- **Font Awesome 5.15.3**: Icon library (CDN)
- **Rawline Font**: Custom font from CDN Fonts

### Government Integration
- **Gov.br**: Links to official government portal
- **IBGE Assets**: Official logos and branding elements

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for Replit's autoscale deployment:

- **Development**: Flask development server with auto-reload
- **Production**: Gunicorn with binding to `0.0.0.0:5000`
- **Environment**: Nix-based with Python 3.11, OpenSSL, and PostgreSQL
- **Scaling**: Autoscale deployment target for handling traffic

The deployment uses parallel workflows for development convenience, allowing both the main project and individual components to be run independently.
